Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming how businesses operate and how users interact with technology. From chatbots to data analysis and personalized experiences, AI is now embedded in many applications. While AI offers numerous benefits, it also introduces new security challenges, especially those related to identity protection. This article explores these challenges and how to use Armur to address them effectively.

### Understanding AI and Its Variants

AI is a broad term that encompasses various technologies. Traditional AI includes symbolic AI methods like logic programming and expert systems, while modern AI uses neural networks and machine learning (ML). One of the most prominent advancements is Generative AI (GenAI), which uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate text, images, videos, and more.

AI-powered applications come with different complexities and risks. Vulnerabilities in AI systems can directly impact the applications that rely on them. Here, we focus on security risks associated with AI-powered applications that organizations are currently building or plan to develop soon.

### Securing GenAI Applications Against Identity Threats

Identity security is crucial when developing AI applications. There are four key areas to consider:

- **User Authentication** – AI applications must verify user identities to personalize experiences. For example, a chatbot may need access to a user’s chat history or personal details to provide relevant responses.
- **Secure API Access** – AI agents connect with multiple applications and must securely call APIs on behalf of users.
- **Asynchronous Workflows** – AI agents often perform tasks over extended periods. Users may need to approve or reject actions remotely, requiring secure background operations.
- **Authorization for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** – AI models pull information from various sources. To prevent unauthorized data exposure, users should only access data they are permitted to view.

Addressing these four requirements ensures GenAI applications remain secure while delivering their full potential.

### AI as a Tool for Cybersecurity

While AI poses security risks, it can also enhance cybersecurity by detecting and mitigating threats more efficiently. Cybercriminals are increasingly using AI to automate social engineering attacks, create deepfakes, and exploit vulnerabilities. Organizations must integrate AI-driven security measures to counteract these threats.

Traditional security methods like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) alone are no longer sufficient. AI can enhance security by:

- Analyzing security signals to detect suspicious login attempts.
- Comparing activity patterns against historical data to identify anomalies.
- Automatically terminating sessions when unauthorized access is detected.

By using AI, organizations can improve threat detection and response, reducing the risk of security breaches.

### Armur as a Tool

With how rapidly technology and attacks are happening, Armur is a useful tool as it helps organizations and developers secure code from GenAI methods. Since most code will be written using AI coding assistants and AI generated code will be the norm. The issue is, developers won't have the bandwidth to check for code safety and this is the problem that our code scanning tools solve.
You can start using our code scanning tools today for languages like GO, Rust, Python, Javascript, what's more awesome is that these tools are available as VSCode extensions and Github apps.

### Looking Ahead

AI is reshaping how humans interact with technology. In the coming years, we will see the rise of AI-driven ecosystems where interconnected AI programs collaborate to enhance applications and automate tasks. However, along with these advancements, security risks will continue to evolve. Developers must prioritize secure AI integration to safeguard users and organizations.
AI is both a powerful tool and a potential risk. While it enhances business operations and user experiences, it also presents new security challenges and that’s the reason Armur exists to help mitigate those challenges.
