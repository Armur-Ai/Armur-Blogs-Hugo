### What Are Zero-Day Exploits?
A zero-day exploit is a cyberattack that capitalizes on a previously unknown vulnerability in software, hardware, or firmware. These vulnerabilities, referred to as zero-day vulnerabilities, are flaws that have not been discovered or patched by the developer or vendor. The term `“zero day”` signifies that there is zero time to fix the issue before it is exploited by attackers.

When a hacker identifies and uses a zero-day vulnerability to breach systems, this is called a zero-day attack. These attacks are particularly dangerous because they target vulnerabilities before security teams are even aware of them. 

#### Characteristics of Zero-Day Exploits:
- **Undetectable by Traditional Tools:** Since the vulnerability is unknown, traditional security measures like antivirus software and intrusion detection systems often fail to recognize the threat.

- **High Value:** Zero-day vulnerabilities are often sold on black markets for hundreds of thousands of dollars, with buyers ranging from cybercriminal groups to nation-states.

- **Wide Impact Potential:** A single zero-day exploit can compromise entire systems, steal sensitive data, and even disrupt critical infrastructure.

Zero-day exploits are not just theoretical risks—they have caused real-world damage like the famous Stuxnet.

Stuxnet was a sophisticated computer worm that exploited four different zero-day software vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows operating systems. In 2010, Stuxnet was used in a series of attacks on nuclear facilities in Iran. Once the worm breached a nuclear plant’s computer systems, it sent malicious commands to the centrifuges used to enrich uranium. These commands caused the centrifuges to spin so fast that they broke down. In total, Stuxnet damaged 1,000 centrifuges.

Researchers believe that the US and Israeli governments worked together to build Stuxnet, but this is unconfirmed.

### Why Are Zero-Day Exploits Rising?

The number of zero-day vulnerabilities discovered and exploited has grown significantly in recent years. For instance, a 2022 Mandiant report found that more zero-day vulnerabilities were exploited in 2021 alone than in the previous three years combined. Several factors contribute to this trend:

1. **Complex Systems and Expanding Attack Surfaces**: Modern organizations rely on a blend of cloud-based services, on-premises applications, IoT devices, and employee-owned endpoints. This complexity creates more potential entry points for zero-day vulnerabilities.

2. **Sophisticated Attackers**: Advanced persistent threat (APT) groups and nation-states invest heavily in discovering and weaponizing zero-day vulnerabilities. These entities prioritize secrecy, often holding onto zero-day flaws for years to maximize their strategic advantage.
3. **AI-Generated Code**: AI coding assistants, while efficient, can inadvertently introduce security vulnerabilities. These tools often lack context-specific safeguards, and the developers using them might not fully understand the generated code. This increases the likelihood of zero-day vulnerabilities embedded in AI-written applications.


### The Increase Reliance on AI-Generated Code
AI-generated code has transformed the way software is developed. Tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, and others can create functional, often complex, code snippets based on simple natural language instructions. This has brought possibilities like enabling people with minimal or no programming experience to contribute to software development. However, it also introduces significant risks, especially when users don’t understand the underlying mechanics of the code they deploy.

AI coding tools simplify programming by translating high-level ideas into executable code. For example:

- A business analyst without a technical background can describe a problem in plain language, and the AI will generate a working solution.
- Developers can save time by letting AI write boilerplate code or tackle intricate algorithms.

This convenience is reshaping workflows across industries. But while AI coding assistants lower the entry barrier, they often produce code that is:

- Opaque: Users may not fully grasp how the generated code works.
- Surface-Level: The AI focuses on meeting the requested functionality, often without considering edge cases or deeper security implications.

Many users trust AI-generated code because it “just works.” If the program compiles or performs as expected, they deploy it without a second thought. This approach has several downstream effects:

- **Hidden Vulnerabilities:** AI models don’t always follow security best practices. They can unknowingly embed vulnerabilities that remain undetected until exploited.
- **Increased Technical Debt:** Code written without understanding the foundational principles can lead to maintenance challenges and inefficiencies later.
- **Over-Reliance on AI:** Developers may become detached from the underlying logic of their applications, making them less equipped to debug, optimize, or secure the software.
- **Greater Risk of Zero-Day Exploits:** Without thorough review, AI-generated code may inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit as zero-day flaws.

This context sets the stage for why tools Armur is essential in today’s development landscape.

### How Armur Mitigates Zero-Day Risks in AI-Generated Code
As AI-generated code becomes the norm, developers face unique challenges. Armur is built to address these challenges and reduce the risks of zero-day vulnerabilities.

1. **LLM Agents for Code Vulnerability Scanning**: AI-generated code is both a blessing and a potential liability. Armur’s LLM agents specialize in analyzing this code to detect critical vulnerabilities. These agents:
- Scan code in popular languages like Python, Rust, Go, and JavaScript.
- Integrate with developer tools like VSCode extensions and GitHub apps.
- Provide actionable insights, helping developers fix vulnerabilities before they are exploited.

This capability ensures that AI-generated code is secure without requiring developers to manually scrutinize every line.

2. **AI-Powered Continuous Penetration Testing**: Manual penetration testing is no longer sufficient in the face of evolving threats. Armur’s autonomous pentesting tools use advanced AI to continuously test systems for vulnerabilities. Key features include:

- Simulation of real-world attacks to uncover zero-day vulnerabilities.
- 24/7 assessment to identify weaknesses before hackers do.
- Simple deployment on a Kali Linux instance.

This ensures that vulnerabilities are identified and addressed proactively.

3. **Bridging Developer Knowledge Gaps**: Developers increasingly rely on AI-generated code, but they may lack the expertise to evaluate its security implications. Armur’s tools automate vulnerability detection, ensuring that developers can focus on building functionality while maintaining robust security.

### Conclusion

The rise of AI-generated code and the growing complexity of modern systems make zero-day vulnerabilities an ever-present threat. However, with proactive tools like Armur, organizations can protect themselves against these elusive risks. By bridging the gap between AI-driven development and security, Armur ensures that innovation does not come at the cost of safety.
