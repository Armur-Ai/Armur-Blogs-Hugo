AI-generated code has transformed software development by automating repetitive tasks, accelerating workflows, and significantly boosting productivity. However, similar to human-written code, it introduces unique security risks that cannot be overlooked. As organizations increasingly integrate AI tools such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot into their development pipelines, securing AI-generated code becomes a critical priority. Vulnerabilities such as improper input handling, use of insecure third-party libraries, and susceptibility to adversarial attacks require careful attention and mitigation.

What makes securing AI-generated code especially interesting is the role AI can play in securing itself. Advanced AI security tools like **Armur** are using Large Language Models (LLMs) to scan, detect, and even remediate vulnerabilities in AI-generated code. This creates a closed-loop system where AI is not only generating but also securing code, making the process more efficient and effective.

This article outlines six key steps to secure AI-generated code and discusses how Armur can use AI to enhance security.

**1. Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**

SAST is a white-box testing technique that analyzes the source code without executing it. This method identifies vulnerabilities by examining the structure, syntax, and logic of the code, which is particularly useful when dealing with AI-generated code that may contain subtle security flaws.

AI tools generate code rapidly, often without the nuanced judgment that human developers would apply. As a result, security vulnerabilities like injection flaws, insecure configurations, or improper input handling can be introduced. Static code analysis allows vulnerabilities to be detected early, reducing the risk of faulty code entering production.

**How Armur enhance SAST:**

- LLM-driven scans: Armur uses advanced LLMs to perform deep static analysis on AI-generated code, identifying vulnerabilities that traditional rule-based systems might miss. It can analyze the code structure and cross-reference it with known vulnerabilities in real-time.
- Automated fixes: In addition to identifying vulnerabilities, Armur can suggests fixes to implement, providing developers with a more efficient path to secure code.

**How to implement SAST effectively:**

- Run frequent scans: Set up automated SAST to analyze AI-generated code as soon as it’s written.
  Integrate SAST into CI/CD pipelines: Ensure that SAST tools are embedded in your continuous integration and delivery pipelines so code is checked regularly.

**2. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**

DAST is a black-box testing technique that tests applications in a runtime environment. It simulates real-world attack scenarios to discover vulnerabilities that can only be identified during execution, such as weak encryption, improper session handling, or misconfigured permissions.

SAST alone is insufficient because it only analyzes code statically. DAST helps identify runtime vulnerabilities by simulating attacks, which is crucial for ensuring that AI-generated code is secure when deployed.

**How AI tools enhance DAST:**  
AI-driven attack simulations: Armur can use AI to simulate a wide variety of attack vectors, improving coverage and detection of complex security issues. The LLM-driven model allows it to adapt to various environments and predict how certain vulnerabilities could be exploited during runtime.

**How to implement DAST effectively:**
Simulate attack scenarios: Use DAST tools to mimic attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or unauthorized access attempts on AI-generated applications.
Test in real environments: Ensure the testing environment mirrors production to identify potential vulnerabilities post-deployment.

**3. Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**

SCA tools focus on identifying and analyzing third-party libraries and dependencies used in your codebase. Since AI-generated code often incorporates external components, these can introduce vulnerabilities if they are outdated or insecure.

AI-generated code may recommend or use third-party libraries that are not fully vetted, which could result in security vulnerabilities or licensing issues. SCA tools can scan these dependencies to ensure they are secure and compliant with your organization's standards.

**How Armur as an AI tool enhance SCA:**

- Real-time dependency tracking: Armur’s LLMs can cross-check AI-suggested dependencies against vast databases of known vulnerabilities. It flags libraries that are outdated, deprecated, or carry potential security risks, and recommends alternatives.
- Automated patching: In addition to flagging vulnerable components, Armur can also automate the process of updating or replacing insecure dependencies.

**How to implement SCA effectively:**
Regularly scan libraries: Continuously use SCA tools to check for vulnerabilities in third-party components.
Enforce dependency management: Use automation tools like Dependabot and Armur to manage and update third-party libraries in your AI-generated code.

**4. Using Secure Coding Practices**

Secure coding practices involve protocols and standards that minimize security risks, such as avoiding hard-coded credentials, properly sanitizing inputs, and using secure encryption techniques.
Why it’s important:  
AI-generated code does not inherently follow secure coding guidelines. It might produce working code, but not necessarily secure code. Therefore, reviewing AI-generated output for security best practices is essential to minimizing the attack surface.

**How AI tools enforce secure coding practices:**

- Code generation aligned with best practices: **Armur** uses LLMs to enforce secure coding standards during code generation. This includes adhering to frameworks like OWASP’s Secure Coding Practices, ensuring that AI-generated code avoids common vulnerabilities like XSS, injection flaws, or insecure cryptography.
- Automated code correction: Armur can automatically modify AI-generated code to ensure compliance with secure coding principles, reducing the burden on developers to review everything manually.

**How to implement secure coding practices:**

- Follow coding standards: Use secure coding guidelines like OWASP to ensure AI-generated code meets best practices.
- Avoid hard-coded secrets: Ensure sensitive data like passwords or API keys are managed through secure vaults, not hard-coded in the application.
- Perform regular code reviews: Require human developers to review AI-generated code to ensure adherence to secure coding practices.

**5. Implementing Security Controls**

Security controls are technical measures designed to ensure that AI-generated code meets security standards throughout the development lifecycle. These include peer reviews, unit tests, integration tests, and compliance checks.

Given the speed at which AI generates code, it’s easy for security vulnerabilities to slip through unnoticed. Security controls, especially when automated, ensure that vulnerabilities are caught early and consistently.

**How AI tools implement security controls:**

- LLM-powered code reviews: Armur can assist developers by performing automated code reviews with a focus on security issues. It identifies potential vulnerabilities during the development process, even before human oversight begins.
- Automated security testing: Armur integrates with CI/CD pipelines to continuously scan for vulnerabilities, providing real-time feedback on security issues.

**How to implement security controls effectively:**

- Set up code reviews: Establish a process where AI-generated code is peer-reviewed for security flaws before merging into the main codebase.
- Automate testing: Use tools like Armur to automate unit tests and security checks.

**6. Training Developers on AI Security**

AI-generated code can lead to over-reliance on machine-generated solutions, with developers potentially overlooking critical security concerns. Training developers to recognize vulnerabilities in AI-generated code and apply secure development practices is essential for maintaining a secure codebase.

**How AI tools assist in training:**

- In-context learning: Armur can provide real-time security tips and guidance as developers review AI-generated code. It can highlight vulnerabilities and explain how they could be exploited, making it an on-the-job training tool.

**How to implement security training effectively:**

- Offer security certifications: Provide your developers with access to secure coding certifications like OWASP or SANS.
- Promote security-first thinking: Encourage developers to prioritize security when generating and reviewing AI-generated code.

### Conclusion

Securing AI-generated code is not only about identifying vulnerabilities but also about employing AI-driven tools to enhance the process. Tools like Armur, leveraging the power of LLMs, offer a sophisticated layer of protection, ensuring that AI-generated code is scanned, analyzed, and secured with minimal manual intervention. By integrating practices like SAST, DAST, SCA, secure coding, and training into your workflow—along with AI-enhanced security measures—you can mitigate risks and ensure your AI-generated code is robust, secure, and ready for production.
