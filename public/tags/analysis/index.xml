      <description>Introduction Static code analysis is an essential process in software development, enabling developers to analyze the structure of code without executing it. This method is widely used to detect security vulnerabilities, bugs, and other defects in software, making it a crucial step in ensuring the quality and security of applications. This article gets into the mechanics of static code analysis, the underlying technology that makes it possible, and the limitations that come with this approach.</description>

      <description>In today&amp;rsquo;s fast-paced digital world, software applications drive every aspect of business operations, from customer engagement to data management. As organizations increasingly rely on these applications, ensuring their security, performance, and quality becomes paramount. However, testing and securing code late in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) can lead to costly errors, security vulnerabilities, and even catastrophic failures in production. To mitigate these risks, engineering teams must adopt robust practices like static analysis early in the SDLC.</description>
